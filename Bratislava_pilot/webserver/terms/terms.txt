The Equipment will then be<br />delivered to your designated address before or on the chosen date. It is your responsibility to inspect all Equipment upon receipt and to verify that it is in good<br />working order and condition. In the event, that we deliver the Equipment before your designated date and you are not available to accept or fail to accept the delivery<br />for any reason, then such Equipment shall still be deemed accepted and you will still be responsible for the return of the Equipment (for rentals) and for all charges.<br />It is your responsibility to ensure that you are available to receive and that you accept the delivery of our Equipment.</p>
